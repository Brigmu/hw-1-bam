            <p>My name is Brigham Mueller and this website was made to tell a little bit about myself and show what I can do. I am an aspiring web designer, gamer, home chef, and dad joke extraordinaire.
                Coding and designing have always been something that have peaked my interest as a way to explore my creative side while still being a relevant way to make a living.  Outside of my time learning and growing my coding experience you can find me, as mentioned, two places: on the computer gaming or in the kitchen.
                Gaming for me has always been a way to be competitive and enjoy myself at the same time. It was also how I connected with a lot of my siblings and gave us a means to spend time together.
                My time in the kitchen is often spent trying new recipes or perfecting ones I already know.  I get a lot of satisfactin out of the enjoyent that other people get when they eat what I have made.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from my 3 main interests I love to play soccer, travel, and hang out with my family. Family is super important to me and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. We love to play board games, word games, video games, or pretty much anything where we can have a good time together.
                I have traveled many places around the world including: China, Ukraine, Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico, and Canada.  My family is really into soccer and I personally played for about 13 years growing up on very competitive teams.
            </p>
            <p>Beyond my personal interests, I am a very logical person who likes to think through pretty much everything I do. I believe in being a kind person to everyone around me and try to help out as much as I can.</p>
