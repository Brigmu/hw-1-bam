Personal Portfolio

Description:

This project is a starting portfolio for my work and learning becoming a web developer.  The main goal of this project is to learn how to use certain techniques that are vital to making a website. This program uses HTML and CSS to provide a basic user experience that can switch between 3 different pages.
The main challenges of the project were creating a pre-specified layout.  Creating a good working nav bar, and footer proved to be the most challenging parts of it. After completion of this project I have a much better understanding of floats, css positioning, and what css elements I need to change in order to move objects on the page around.
The future of this project is to redo it adding bootstrap and javascript in order to have a more responsive website.

Installation:
